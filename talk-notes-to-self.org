* Take one
- It took 20 minutes
- Not bad
- Avoid clicking sounds with my mouth.
- Slow down. Get the correct pauses and pacing. People will play the video at 1.5x.
- Lose the video. It's distracting.
- Lose the url bar.
- Stick to the script for short points. Freestyle with long lists.
- Don't be afraid to be excited. Don't overdo it either.
- Get comfortable. Be genuine. Be natural.
- Be confident. It's just a friendly chat about ideas.
- Noticeably stiff at the beginning.
- It's ok to read. If I get tongue tied, pause. We can cut pauses in post.
- Don't say "socio-political".
